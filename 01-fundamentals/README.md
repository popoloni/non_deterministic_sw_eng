## Overview

This section covers the foundational concepts from Part I of the book:

- **Chapter 1: The Fundamental Shift** — Understanding the paradigm change from deterministic to non-deterministic programming
- **Chapter 2: Vibe Coding vs. AI-Assisted Engineering** — Distinguishing rapid prototyping from production-ready engineering
- **Chapter 3: The Experience Divide** — How AI affects engineers at different career stages

## Key Concepts

### The Non-Deterministic Shift

Traditional software engineering assumes deterministic tools — the same input always produces the same output. AI assistants break this assumption, requiring new approaches to:

- Verification and validation
- Quality assurance
- Code review processes
- Testing strategies

### The 70% Rule

AI-generated code often gets you 70% of the way there. The remaining 30% — edge cases, error handling, security considerations — requires human expertise.

### Vibe Coding vs. Professional Engineering

| Vibe Coding | Professional AI-Assisted Engineering |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| "It works!" | "It works correctly, securely, and maintainably" |
| Minimal verification | Comprehensive testing |
| Quick iteration | Thoughtful iteration |
| Suitable for prototypes | Suitable for production |
